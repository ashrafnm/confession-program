# confession-program
C++ source code to confess to someone

How does this program work?
1.Send them this code and ask them to compile it (online compiler etc)
2.There is password set inside the program so you need to enter the password to start the game
  (default password: 123) but you can change to whatever you like
3.Program will ask for your name and few questions. If they say no, there'll be response until they say yes.
4.Then, they will be asked to promise you 3 things (you can edit them later)
5.Finally there will be a message telling that you love them at the end with heart symbol and entered name in it.

You can edit:
1. Password
2. Questions (Do you love me etc..)
3. Promises

Enjoy!!!
